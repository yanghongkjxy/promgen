### Setting up Promgen for development

You can install Promgen for a development environment as follows.

```bash
python3 -m venv /path/to/virtualenv
source /path/to/virtualenv/bin/activate
pip install -e .[dev]
pip install mysqlclient # psycopg or another database driver
# Boostrap initial configuration
promgen bootstrap
# Enable DEBUG (and development) mode
echo 1 > ~/.config/promgen/DEBUG

# Amend bootstrapped configuration by hand: ~/.config/promgen/promgen.yml

# Setup or update database schemas, create initial user and shard
promgen migrate
# Run tests
promgen test
# Run development server
promgen runserver
```

By default promgen listens on port `8000`. Login with the user `admin` and password `admin`.
Remember to change the password!

> Note: Promgen strives to be a standard Django application. Make sure to apply standard Django development patterns.

#### Custom Configuration Directory

By default `promgen` uses `~/.config/promgen` as its configuration directory.
This can be changed by setting the environment variable `PROMGEN_CONFIG_DIR` to an alternative location whenever calling `promgen ...` commands.
